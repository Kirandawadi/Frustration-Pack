/*********Timers************************/
TIM1 - Angle Calculations
TIM2 - PWM for base motor (PA5)
TIM3 - Timer for Stepper Refresher that runs in 20ms
TIM4 - Encoder for base motor (Is running in both channel mode)
TIM5 - Encoder for left_right stepper 
TIM6 - Timer for PID refresher

/*************USART**********/
USART2_TX - PA2
USART2_RX - PA3

/*******H Bridge*****/
IN1 - PC0
IN2 - PC1

OUT1 - Black Wire
OUT2 - Red Wire


/*****Encoders Wiring*******/
/*Here the wire just after VCC is channel1 ,then channel2 and GND*/
Encoder for base motor:
Channel1 - PD13
Channel2 - PD12

Encoder for left_right_stepper:
Channel1 - PA0
Channel2 - PA1

/*****Signals and Directions for Stepper********/
For Left_Right Stepper:
	Signal: PC2
	Direction: PC3
	
Angle is positive while going right and is negative while going left
But the encoder reads up from 0 while going left and decreases from overflow value while going right
